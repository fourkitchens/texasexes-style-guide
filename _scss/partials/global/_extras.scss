// Hide elements from all users.
//
// Used for elements which should not be immediately displayed to any user. An
// example would be a collapsible fieldset that will be expanded with a click
// from a user. The effect of this class can be toggled with the jQuery show()
// and hide() functions.

// Hide elements visually, but keep them available for screen-readers.
//
// Used for information required for screen-reader users to understand and use
// the site where visual display is undesirable. Information provided in this
// manner should be kept concise, to avoid unnecessary burden on the user.
// "!important" is used to prevent unintentional overrides.

// Some elements should be hidden when JavaScript is available. Notably, the
// submit buttons in autosubmit forms like the Benefit Browser view's exposed
// filters. This is taken from system.base.css:
html.js .js-hide {
  display: none;
